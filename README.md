# The WebDev Grind — Daily Learning, JS Deep Dives & Mini-Projects

**A hands-on log of learning web development: covering JS fundamentals, mini-projects, and real-world practice files.**

## 📘 Overview

This repository is my personal journal of learning web development. It includes:
- Core JavaScript concepts and exercises (basic to advanced).  
- Mini-projects to practice HTML, CSS, JS (and optionally other web technologies).  
- Practice files and experiments to consolidate concepts.  

Use this repo as reference or inspiration if you are learning web development and want to see how a beginner-to-intermediate learner organizes learning + code.

## 🚀 Motivation & What You’ll Learn

I started this repo to:

- Keep track of my progress as I learn JS, the DOM, and build small web applications.  
- Build a portfolio of small but meaningful projects that reflect my learning journey.  
- Provide a structured place to revisit concepts — from basics (arrays, objects, loops) to more complex tasks (mini-apps, UI + functionality).  

By exploring this repo you’ll find step-by-step examples of how to build up foundational skills in JS, HTML, and CSS — along with code you can fork and modify.

## 📂 Repo Structure (at a glance)

- `/week1`, `/week2`, ... — weekly exercises and concept work.  
- Mini-projects folder(s) — small apps and demos built during learning.  
- Practice files — helper scripts, sandbox code, utilities, experiments.  

(You may expand or restructure as needed as the repo grows.)

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayurbadgujar03/WebDev-journey.git
